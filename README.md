# Flying Bubbles

### A Colorful HTML5 Game for [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/). - 10kB (zipped)

Music was composed by me back in 2013 and i was about to forget about it until this game.

I've used:
- [TinyMusic](https://github.com/kevincennis/TinyMusic) for play the music. (3kB)
- [kontra.js](https://github.com/straker/kontra) for 2D rendering. (3kB)

Both are great projects that helped me the finish this game in 2 days from start to finish.
